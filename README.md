# Polytech-Works
Ensemble of machine learning projects from Polytech.

Projects:

## 1 - Sleep Phase Classification

This projects aims to classificate in what part of sleep the person are with
his brain activities information.

It uses and compare the classification algorithmns: Gaussian Naive Bayesian, 
Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis.

## 2 - Classification of natural and artificial images, and classification of image subject.

This project aims to classificate images as natural or artificial as well as
its classes (for example, if the image is a forest, city, and so on)

It uses and compare the classification algorithmns: SVM, MLP, CNN, and 
Transfer learning method with fine tunning, using VGG16.

(To run, it needs to unzip the images in its folder.)

## 3 - Diagnostic of coronary disease in patients

This project aims to detect whether the patient has coronary disease using data from blood 
analysis, electrocardiograms, and physical characteristics of the patient.

## 4 - Classification of whether a tumor is cancerous using an unsupervised method

This project aims to determine whether a tumor is cancerous using data from a sample taken from the patient's tumor. 
The extracted characteristics of the sample are already available in the dataset for this task.

The K-means algorithm is used as the clustering method to address this problem
