# Polytech-Works
Ensemble of machine learning projects from Polytech.

Projects:

## 1 - Sleep Phase Classification

This projects aims to classificate in what part of sleep the person are with
his brain activities information.

It uses and compare the classification algorithmns: Gaussian Naive Bayesian, 
Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis.

## 2 - Classification of natural and artificial images, and its classes.

This project aims to classificate images as natural or artificial as well as
its classes (for example, if the image is a forest, city, and so on)

It uses and compare the classification algorithmns: SVM, MLP, CNN, and 
Transfer learning with fine tunning, using VGG16.

(To run, it needs to unzip the images in its folder.)
